significance: patch
type: dev
entry: Added `llms_rewrite_slugs` filter hook. Third parties can be leverage this
  filter hook to add their localized slugs, and re-use them,
  retrieving them via `LLMS_Post_Types::get_rewrite_slugs()`, when
  registering their post types and taxonomies. This filter is fired  when the
  current locale has been already switched to the site locale.
